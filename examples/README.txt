nna_methods Example Gallery
============================

This gallery houses examples on how to use nna_method to do various
analyses. The focus here is on using freely available data to make
products that could be reproduced.

Some examples require libraries that are not directly required by nna_methods.
To install all the necessary libaries for any example, run the command below
(use --user if not an admin):

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m pip install --user pyrsig pycno pyproj netcdf4

In notebooks (e.g., on Google Colab), this can be done live with
the command below (may require kernel restart):

.. code-block:: python

   %pip install --user pyrsig pycno pyproj netcdf4

To run an example in a notebook:

1. Copy the command above into a new cell and run it.
2. Click on example below to see code.
3. Copy the code from the example into a new cell and run it.
